                                        <p> Mometrix Test Preparation was founded in 2002 with a simple vision: to help test-takers cut through all of the fluff and distractions in order to get to the heart of exactly what it takes to succeed on the exam.
                                            We watched helplessly as too many of our well-qualified friends and relatives struggled to get into the school of their choice, or earn the certification necessary to get or keep a job, simply because they didn't
                                            test well. We decided there must be a better way to prepare, so we made it our mission to give test-takers exactly what they need in order to maximize their potential. Our goal is for our study materials, coupled
                                            with diligent effort, to empower a test-taker to attain the highest score within their ability to achieve. We help people achieve their dreams by helping them overcome the testing hurdles necessary for them
                                            to get to where they want to be. Our materials are available on every major digital platform and are distributed worldwide. Every year, millions of test-takers utilize Mometrix materials, including free online
                                            resources, study guides, flashcards, digital content, and apps for the web and smartphone. We also have the largest catalog of any test preparation publisher, now offering over 3,500 products covering more than
                                            1,500 different standardized exams. Keeping up with the constant changes in the many different exam markets we cover, our product development team averages more than 100 product updates each week. Mometrix study
                                            materials comprise a collection of over 174 million words, larger than the entire print history of TIME Magazine. Mometrix is a privately owned company based in the southeast Texas metropolitan area, with printing
                                            and distribution facilities in Tyler County, Texas. An A+ member of the BBB since 2003, we research, develop, produce and retail our test preparation products to test-takers all over the world. Our products
